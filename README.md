This applicaiton allows students at the Univeristy of Virginia to make virtual study connections with other students. The application can be reached [here](https://virtual-study-buddy-finder.herokuapp.com/). It is generally divided into three sections, **Profile**, **Explore**, and **My Buddies**, covered in more detail below. On first launch, the application will guide new users through the process of creating an account. Creation of profile requries the user to have a Google log-in.

## Profile:
In this section of the application, the user can create and edit their profile information such as Contact Information, Courses, and Availability.

*The following fields are required for the creation of a profile:*
- First Name
- Last Name
- Major
- Bio
- At least one course
- UVA Computing ID

*Users must select at least one availability block when editing profile information*

## Explore:
In this section of the application, the user can see and connect with available study buddies.

Users will only be shown other students who share at least one class.

Avaliable buddies can be filtered by major, by class, and by percent availablity match. 

## My Buddies:
In this section of the application, the user can see their connected buddies, buddies pending their approval, and their requested buddies.

Contact information is hidden until buddy requests are approved. 

As of right now, denying a buddy request ***is final***. Denied buddies will not re-appear in explore page.
